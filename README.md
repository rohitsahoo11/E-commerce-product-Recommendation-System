AI-Powered Fashion Recommender System
Welcome to the AI-Powered Fashion Recommender System! This project leverages deep learning and computer vision techniques to recommend fashion items based on visual similarities. The system uses a pre-trained ResNet50 model to extract features from images and the Nearest Neighbors algorithm to find similar items.

Project Overview
The AI-Powered Fashion Recommender System is designed to enhance the shopping experience for users by providing personalized recommendations based on the visual characteristics of fashion items. Users can upload an image of a fashion item, and the system will suggest similar items from the catalog.

Features
Image Feature Extraction: Uses a pre-trained ResNet50 model to extract features from fashion item images.
Similarity Search: Employs the Nearest Neighbors algorithm to find and recommend visually similar items.
Interactive Web Interface: Built with Streamlit for a user-friendly and interactive experience.
Image Upload: Users can upload images of fashion items to get recommendations.
Real-time Recommendations: Provides recommendations based on uploaded images in real-time.
Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or later
TensorFlow
Streamlit
scikit-learn
OpenCV
Pillow
tqdm
NumPy
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fashion-recommender-system.git
cd fashion-recommender-system
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download and prepare the dataset:

Place your fashion item images in the Fashion Recommender System/images directory.
Ensure the images are labeled and organized appropriately.
Extract features from images:

Run the feature extraction script to preprocess the images and save the features:

bash
Copy code
python extract_features.py
Usage
Start the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Upload an image:

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8501.
Use the file uploader to upload an image of a fashion item.
Get Recommendations:

After uploading the image, the system will display similar fashion items based on the visual features of the uploaded image.
